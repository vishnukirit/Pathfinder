# Pathfinder
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm using Python's `curses` library to navigate a maze. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from start ('O') to end ('X'), while avoiding obstacles ('#'). Features include dynamic visuals, real-time exploration updates, and interactive terminal graphics.
